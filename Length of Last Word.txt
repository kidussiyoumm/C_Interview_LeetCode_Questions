Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.


Answer:

public class Solution {
    public int LengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        if(s.Length == 0){
            return 0;
        }
         
            //this will trim all the spaces before and after the entire string
            var trimed = s.Trim();

            //this will give the last index of the chosen word from the right doing to left 
            var lastIndex = trimed.LastIndexOf(' ');

            //then this will chose the subtring from the string from the passed index or number in the method
            var strings = trimed.Substring(lastIndex + 1);


            return strings.Length;
        
        }
        
 }
