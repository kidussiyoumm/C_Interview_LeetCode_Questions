Split a String in Balanced Strings

Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:

Each substring is balanced.

Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains 
same number of 'L' and 'R'.



public class Solution {
    public int BalancedStringSplit(string s) {
        int balance = 0;
        int maxSubstring = 0;

        if(s.Length == 0){
            return 0;
        }

        foreach(char c in s){
            if(c == 'R'){
                balance++;
            }else{
                balance--;
            }

            if(balance == 0){
                maxSubstring++;
            }
        }

        return maxSubstring;
    }
}
