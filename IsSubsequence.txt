IsSubsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
public class program{
     
    public static void Main(String[] args)
    {

          practiceTest solution = new practiceTest();

	   
	            string s = "abc";
         string t = "ahbfc";
         var vlaue = solution.IsSubsequence(s, t);
         Console.WriteLine($"This isSequence :{vlaue}");

    }
	
	   public bool IsSubsequence(string s, string t)
    {
      int sPointer = 0;
      int tPointer = 0;
      int sLength = s.Length;
      int tLenght = t.Length;

      while (sPointer < sLength && tPointer < tLenght) {
          if (s[sPointer] == t[tPointer])
          {
              sPointer++;
          }
          tPointer++;
          } 
      return sPointer == sLength; 
    }
}
